This repository contains the accompanying code and data for the paper [Optimizing testing policies for detecting COVID-19 outbreaks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04827)

The notebook [Varying_params](https://github.com/boazbk/testingstrategies/blob/main/Varying_params.ipynb) contains the code running the experiment. 

The data of our numerical simulations is in the folder [data/20201020_14_12_29_400](https://github.com/boazbk/testingstrategies/tree/main/data/20201020_14_12_29_400)

Our simulation code is in the repository [boazbk/seirsplus](https://github.com/boazbk/seirsplus) which is a fork of the repository [ryansmcgee/seirsplus](https://github.com/ryansmcgee/
